- 👋 Hi, I’m Patrick Briand (@scss-pbriand)
- 👀 I’m interested in .NET Core, .NET Framework, MVC, MVVM, EF, Javascript, etc.
- 🌱 I’m always trying to learn and adapt to become a better developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that comes my way.  I love coding.
- 📫 I can be reached on Teams, by email or by cell.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: A smile is of great value even though it costs nothing.  It enriches those who receive it without taking from those who give it.
